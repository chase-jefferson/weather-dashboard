# Weather Dashboard


## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard application using an external API that calls the OpenWeather API and renders data in the browser. The user is able to search any city in the world and a 5-day forecast will appear. The search is saved, and the user is able to go back to any previously searched city.
